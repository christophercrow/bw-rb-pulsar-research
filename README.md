# Black Widow and Redback Pulsar Evolution with PARI

## Overview

This repository tracks the research project aimed at reconstructing the evolutionary pathways of **spider pulsar systems**—specifically, *black widow* and *redback* binaries—by combining advanced population synthesis and stellar evolution modeling (using COSMIC and METISSE) with targeted radio observations from the 26-meter radio telescope at Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute (PARI).

## Scientific Motivation

Black widow and redback pulsars are millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in close binary systems with low-mass companions. These systems are among the most extreme laboratories for understanding:
- The late stages of binary stellar evolution
- The physics of mass transfer, ablation, and neutron star recycling
- The fate of compact binaries in the Galaxy

Despite major progress, key questions remain about:
- How these systems form and evolve
- What determines the efficiency of companion ablation or destruction
- How theoretical models compare to the observed Galactic population

By combining detailed **modeling** with **empirical data from PARI**, this project aims to bridge the gap between population synthesis theory and the real, observable pulsar population.

## Central Research Question

> **How can we reconstruct the evolutionary history of a black widow or redback system using radio observations from PARI and detailed binary evolution modeling, and what does this reveal about the formation mechanisms and future of spider pulsars?**

## Research Objectives

- **Reconstruct the evolutionary history** of specific spider pulsar systems observable by PARI
- **Test the predictions** of population synthesis models for the distribution of orbital periods, companion masses, and detectability
- **Quantify the impact** of observational selection effects (e.g., radio eclipses, sensitivity limits) on the observed population
- **Constrain the physics** of mass transfer, ablation, and binary evolution using real data and simulations
